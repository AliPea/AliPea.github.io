user_description: After graduating with a B.A. in Political Economy from U.C. Berkeley and while working in financial services in London, I started coding in my spare time. I learned about programming by playing video games since I was young and always enjoyed the learning curve - it was rewarding and fun. I attended General Assembly in London, where I learned to make websites mainly using MEAN stack and Ruby. Through my work experience I have learned also to develop using PHP frameworks. I enjoy working with other smart and driven individuals who inspire me to be better. I go by this quote which sums it up; 'If you are the smartest person in the room, then you are in the wrong room.'
